- Centralize documentation
- Regroup the community and organize events when we'll be ready (hopefully)

Fell free to join !

## Wiki

Everything to know is in the [Wiki](https://github.com/a-blondel/mohh2-server/wiki)  
It contains :

## Development Status

**Work In Progress** - The Wii version allows to access the main menu, leaderboards and lobbies while the PSP version disconnects before login screen.  
You can follow the progress on the [project board](https://github.com/users/a-blondel/projects/2/views/1).

## Requirements

### 1/ Riivolution patches (Wii only)

To make the game to use this server you need to activate Riivolution patches when starting the game.  
Patches can be found here : https://github.com/a-blondel/mohh2-wii-patch

### 2/ Hosts file or DNS

In order to intercept requests from the game, you must either use a DNS server or edit your hosts file.

- Hosts file (for Dolphin)

Add these lines to your hosts file (`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`) :
```
127.0.0.1 wiimoh08.ea.com
127.0.0.1 pspmoh08.ea.com
127.0.0.1 naswii.nintendowifi.net
```

- DNS (for the Wii / PSP)

  - Host a DNS server (i.e. [Unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/)) to redirect packets to the machine hosting the server.
  - Configure the console to use the DNS server

Unbound configuration (`service.conf`) :
```
server:
	# verbosity level 0-4 of logging
	verbosity: 1

	# On windows you may want to make all the paths relative to the
	# directory that has the executable in it (unbound.exe).  Use this.
	directory: "%EXECUTABLE%"

	# if you want to log to a file use
	logfile: "unbound.log"
	
	interface: ::1
	interface: 127.0.0.1
	interface: 192.168.1.1 # CHANGE IT !
	
	port: 53
	
	access-control: 127.0.0.0/24 allow
	access-control: 192.168.0.0/16 allow
	access-control: ::1 allow
	
	root-hints: "named.cache"
	
	local-zone: "wiimoh08.ea.com" static
	local-data: "wiimoh08.ea.com A 192.168.1.1" # CHANGE IT !
	
	local-zone: "pspmoh08.ea.com" static
    local-data: "pspmoh08.ea.com A 192.168.1.1" # CHANGE IT !
    
    local-zone: "naswii.nintendowifi.net" static
    local-data: "naswii.nintendowifi.net A 192.168.1.1" # CHANGE IT !
```

Change `192.168.1.1` to your server's IP address.


### 3/ JDK

This project has been initiated with the `JDK 17`, download it if needed.

### 4/ Maven

If you have downloaded Intellij, Maven comes bundled with, otherwise download the latest version of Maven.

#### Maven profile

**Some properties like the SSL port are region-dependant, therefore they must be changed accordingly to the version of the game.**  
A maven profile exists for each region:
- `wii-pal` : RM2X69 and RM2P69
- `wii-ntsc` : RM2E69

Currently, all profiles are located in *application.yml* as there won't be many region-based properties.  
**When you don't specify any maven profile, it fallbacks to `wii-pal`.**

### 5/ Define the host machine

Configuration is defined in `application.yml`.

Currently, multiplayer isn't supported (only single player online), so `udp.host` can remain `127.0.0.1`, players will "host themselves".

As for `tcp.host`, it depends on your use case :
- If you are running the server (not in WSL) and the game on the same machine (using Dolphin), and you don't need to host for other machines, then no changes are needed.
- If you are running the server (in WSL) and the game on the same machine (using Dolphin), and you don't need to host for other machines, then you must set the WSL's eth0 IP.
- If you are running the server for other machines (i.e. Wii/PSP, or another computer using Dolphin), then you must set the machine IP (works for private and public networks).

## Run the server

### 1. Build the project

Run the following command :  
`mvn clean package`

### 2.a Start the server in Intellij

Create a new Application config in Intellij and set the following entry-point (main class) :
```
com.ea.ServerApp
```

The default profile is `wii-pal`.  
If you need to specify a profile, be sure to check `Add VM options` (or use Alt+V), then fill the field with :
```
-Dspring.profiles.active=wii-ntsc
```

Define the environment variables matching your need, mostly for the database (see `Database` chapter), e.g. :
```
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mohh2db;DB_USERNAME=user;DB_PASSWORD=password;LOGS=C:/moh/logs;TCP_HOST_IP=127.0.0.1
```

Replace with your own values.

### 2.b Start as a standalone jar

After a successful build, get into the target folder and execute one the following commands:
```
java -DDB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mohh2db -DDB_USERNAME=user -DDB_PASSWORD=password -DLOGS=C:/moh/logs -DTCP_HOST_IP=127.0.0.1 -jar mohh2-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If you need to specify a profile, add the following option :
```
-Dspring.profiles.active=wii-ntsc
```

### 2.c Start with Docker

Open a terminal at the root of the project (where the Dockerfile is located). If you are using WSL :
```
cd /mnt/c/path/to/the/project
```

Create the image
```
docker build --tag mohh2-server:latest .
```

- Wii PAL with postgres

First, you need to start a postgres container after creating a network :
```
docker network create mohh2-network

docker run -d --rm --network mohh2-network \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=user \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mohh2db \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  --name postgres \
  postgres:latest
```

Then, you can start the server using the network :
```
docker run --name mohh2-wii-pal --rm -it \
  -p 21171:21171 -p 21172:21172 -p 21173:21173 \
  -e "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=wii-pal" -e "LOGS=./logs" -e "TCP_HOST_IP=127.0.0.1" \
  -e "DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/mohh2db" \
  -e "DB_USERNAME=user" -e "DB_PASSWORD=password" \
  --network mohh2-network \
  mohh2-server:latest
```

- Wii NTSC with postgres

Follow the same steps as above to define the network and add postgres to it.  
Then, you can start the server using the network :
```
docker run --name mohh2-wii-ntsc --rm -it \
  -p 21121:21121 -p 21172:21172 -p 21173:21173 \
  -e "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=wii-ntsc" -e "LOGS=./logs" -e "TCP_HOST_IP=127.0.0.1" \
  -e "DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/mohh2db" \
  -e "DB_USERNAME=user" -e "DB_PASSWORD=password" \
  --network mohh2-network \
  mohh2-server:latest
```

If started in background, here is how to open a bash in the container :
```
docker container ls
docker exec -it <container-id> bash
```

Note that you can use a volume to persist the data of the postgres container and 
automatically restart the container when you boot WSL, see the `Database` chapter for more information.

## Database
To manage the database schema, **liquibase** is used.  

It is recommended to use a **postgres** database.  
You can install it on your machine or use a docker container.  

Data samples are provided in the `db/samples` folder for a quick start :
- `basic.sql` (lightweight, suitable for most cases)
- `full.sql` (mainly for leaderboards testing)

You can use a docker container to run an instance of postgres :
```
docker pull postgres:latest

docker run -d --rm \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=user \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mohh2db \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  --name postgres \
  postgres:latest
```

To persist the data and automatically restart the container when you boot WSL, you can use :
```
docker pull postgres:latest

mkdir ~/postgres_data

docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped \
-e POSTGRES_USER=user \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
-e POSTGRES_DB=mohh2db \
-p 5432:5432 \
-v ~/postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
--name postgres \
postgres:latest
```

Don't forget to set the environment variables (`DB_URL`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD`) of the server !  
See "Run the server" chapter for a full example.

## Connect Mode

To enable `connect mode`, set `udp.connect-mode.enabled` to `true` in `application.yml`.  
Don't forget to replace `41` by `40` at `0x8001BEB4`.
